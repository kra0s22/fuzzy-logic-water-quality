## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Fuzzy-logic is used for specific cases where it is not possible to distinguise correctly the values of diffent atributos of something that we would like to categorize. Due to it, we used this logic to categorize the water quality depending od its temperaute, equivalent conductivity and disolved oxygen. 

## üí≠ How it works <a name = "working"></a>

### Antecedents and Consequents

The antecedents are the input variables and the consequents are the output variables. In this case, the antecedents are the temperature, the equivalent conductivity and the disolved oxygen and the consequents are the water quality.

```python
temperature['low'] = fuzz.trimf(temperature.universe, [0, 0, 20])
temperature['intermedium'] = fuzz.trimf(temperature.universe, [0, 20, 30])
temperature['high'] = fuzz.trapmf(temperature.universe, [20, 30, 40, 40])
```

```python
ec['low'] = fuzz.trimf(ec.universe, [0, 0, 400])
ec['intermedium'] = fuzz.trimf(ec.universe, [0, 400, 1000])
ec['high'] = fuzz.trapmf(ec.universe, [400, 1000, 2000, 2000])
```

![water_quality1_graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kra0s22/fuzzy-logic-water-quality/master/Images/ec.png)

```python
oxygen['low'] = fuzz.trimf(oxygen.universe, [0, 0, 3])
oxygen['intermedium'] = fuzz.trimf(oxygen.universe, [0, 3, 6])
oxygen['high'] = fuzz.trapmf(oxygen.universe, [3, 8, 10, 10])
```

![water_quality1_graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kra0s22/fuzzy-logic-water-quality/master/Images/disolved_oxygen.png)

```python
ctrl.Consequent(np.arange(0, 101, 1), 'water quality', defuzzify_method="centroid"))
```

### Rules

The rules are applied to the antecedents, generating its conequents. In this case, we have 4 rules that we want to apply to the antecedents and consequents.

```python
rule1 = ctrl.Rule(temperature['low'] & oxygen['high'] & ~ ec['high'], quality['excellent'])
rule2 = ctrl.Rule(temperature['intermedium'] & ~ oxygen['high'], quality['good'])
rule3 = ctrl.Rule(oxygen['intermedium'] & ~ temperature['low'], quality['good'])
rule4 = ctrl.Rule(temperature['high'] & oxygen['low'] & ~ ec['high'], quality['fair'])
```

### Consequents variation depending on the antecedents values

The consequents are defuzzified to get the percentage of quality of water. In this case, we have 5 different defuzzifications, each one with a different value of the antecedents.

#### Disolved oxygen fluctuation visualization

#### Equivalent conductivity fluctuation visualization

### Evaluation

The evaluation is done by applying the rules to the antecedents and consequents. In this case, we have 5 different evaluations, each one with a different value of the antecedents.

For a esasiest visualization, we plot the graphs of the antecedents and consequents for each evaluation and defuzzify the consequents to get the percentage of quality of water.

```python
water quality: 75%
```

![water_quality1_graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kra0s22/fuzzy-logic-water-quality/master/Images/water_quality2_graph.png)

```python
water quality: 64%
```

![water_quality1_graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kra0s22/fuzzy-logic-water-quality/master/Images/water_quality3_graph.png)

```python
water quality: 62%
```
![water_quality1_graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kra0s22/fuzzy-logic-water-quality/master/Images/water_quality4_graph.png)

```python
water quality: 47%
```
![water_quality1_graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kra0s22/fuzzy-logic-water-quality/master/Images/water_quality5_graph.png)

```python
water quality: 38%
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
